# Musicpedia
A music information website which provides music contents to users.

A Database Management System course project. In this project, we designed, stored and managed our database in department (CISE) Oracle database server. We used Nodejs to connect to department's Oracle database server, processed the query, retrieved table and displayed result to user.

Dataset source:
  http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/

implementing environment:
  1. Mac OS X
  2. Nodejs

Notice:
1. To use University's Oracle db, you need to be a UF student and with corresponding several accounts.

2. Outside the campus, a UF vpn is needed to get access into Oracle (a gatorLink account (UF account) is needed for VPN)

3. After turning on the server.js (in IDE or nodejs command), the website is set on localhost:3000

4. I put a SQL sheet into repository, it contains all the SQL we designed to exploit the dataset and used them to provide contents to user. They are just samples and modified a little bit in application but the core ideas are not changed.

5. I took snapshots of our webpage as well, you can check them out if you haven't set environment ready yet or just don't care to do that.
